# Localization - Spanish Scheduler


<p>This example demonstrates how to localize the XtraScheduler and the DateNavigator controls in the application, i.e. translate them to Spanish. Pre-built satellite assemblies for the Spanish language are used. Satellite assemblies for different languages are available online in the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/A421">The collection of localized DevExpress assemblies</a>  article as file attachments.</p>
